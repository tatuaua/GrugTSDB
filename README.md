# GrugTSDB

## Done:
* Basic In-Memory Storage: Implemented a simple in-memory storage engine for time series data.
* Data Ingestion: Ability to ingest time series data points into the storage engine.
* Basic Querying: Implemented basic querying capabilities to retrieve time series data.
* Basic Streaming: Implemented a simple streaming mechanism to allow streaming writes to a UDP client.
* Timestamping: Ability to associate data points with specific points in time.
* Querying by Time Range: Efficient retrieval of data within specified time intervals.
* Basic Aggregations: Support for common aggregate functions (e.g., average, sum, min, max, count) over time windows.
* Web Interface: A simple web interface to interact with the time series database, allowing users to insert and query data.

## Roadmap:
* Concurrency: Implement concurrency control to handle multiple simultaneous writes and reads
